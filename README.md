## Overview

The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) is an international coalition formed to enable the responsible, voluntary, and secure sharing of genomic and health-related data. This awesome list collects resources, projects, tools, and standards from the GA4GH ecosystem that support the mission of enabling responsible data sharing.

## Core Standards

- **[GA4GH API Specifications](https://www.ga4gh.org/news/ga4gh-standards/)** - Key API standards such as the Data Repository Service (DRS), Workflow Execution Service (WES), and more.
- **[Beacon API](https://beacon-project.io/)** - A web service that allows the search for specific genetic variants in datasets.
- **[Phenopackets](https://phenopackets-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** - A standard for sharing phenotype data across institutions.
- **[Refget](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/refget.html)** - A specification for accessing reference sequences using their checksums.

## Projects and Tools

- **[DRS: Data Repository Service](https://ga4gh.github.io/data-repository-service-schemas/)** - A standard API for accessing data in a distributed system of repositories.
- **[WES: Workflow Execution Service](https://ga4gh.github.io/workflow-execution-service-schemas/)** - A standard for running and managing workflows on a compute service.
- **[TES: Task Execution Service](https://ga4gh.github.io/task-execution-schemas/)** - Provides a standardized interface for executing a single task on a compute backend.
- **[HTSGET: High-Throughput Sequencing Data Retrieval API](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/htsget.html)** - A protocol for streaming read data (BAM/CRAM) and variant data (VCF/BCF) over HTTP.
- **[VRS: Variation Representation Specification](https://vr-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** - A standard for representing and exchanging data about genetic variation.
- **[Phenopacket-tools](https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-tools)** - A set of tools for working with the Phenopacket standard.
- **[Schema Blocks](https://schemablocks.org/)** - A catalog of reusable JSON Schema blocks for creating interoperable data standards.

## Ecosystem

- **[GA4GH Cloud](https://ga4gh.cloud/)** - A suite of standards and tools for federated cloud computing in genomics.
- **[ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/)** - A European research infrastructure for life science data.
- **[AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/)** - A cloud-based environment for large-scale analysis of genomic data.
- **[The Beacon Network](https://beacon-network.org/)** - A search engine for finding genomic data across a network of Beacons.

## Community

- **[GA4GH Membership](https://www.ga4gh.org/membership/)** - How to get involved in the GA4GH community.
- **[GA4GH Working Groups](https://www.ga4gh.org/work_streams/)** - The different work streams and working groups within GA4GH.
- **[GA4GH Connect](https://www.ga4gh.org/ga4gh-connect/)** - Annual events and updates from the GA4GH community.
- **[Code of Conduct](https://www.ga4gh.org/code-of-conduct/)** - Guidelines for participating in the GA4GH community.
